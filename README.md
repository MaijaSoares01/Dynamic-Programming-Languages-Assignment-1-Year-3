Create a Basic HTML Web page that functions as a Restaurant’s Breakfast Bill Calculator. Here are some directions :
● Create a Basic HTML document, with <script> tag for Javascript.
● Give an ID “standardBill” to one of it’s <h1> tag elements.
● Create a function “newOrder” that calculates the bill for the breakfast.
● Creates 4 variables named Egg, Bread, Jam & Milk.
● Assign price number values 2, 1, 4 & 3 respectively.
● You will call the function with quantities as arguments.
● You’ll take user inputs, via HTML <input> tag.
● User inputs will dictate the quantities of each item.
● A button will trigger your function.
● So your function will multiply the parameters with prices & add all.
● Display Bill’s value via <h1>’s ID.
● In addition, you’ll accommodate a situation, where if a customer orders all items in double quantity, i.e. 2, then a Discount of 20% must get calculated & displayed.
