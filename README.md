## Basic HTML and JavaScript Breakfast Bill Calculator

### Objective
The goal of this project is to create a basic HTML document with a JavaScript function that calculates the bill for a breakfast order. The user can input quantities for different items, and the total bill will be displayed.

### Features
- Create a basic HTML document with a `<script>` tag for JavaScript.
- Assign an ID “standardBill” to one of the `<h1>` tag elements.
- Create a function named “newOrder” that calculates the bill for the breakfast.
- Create 4 variables named `Egg`, `Bread`, `Jam`, and `Milk`.
  - Assign price number values: 
    - `Egg`: 2
    - `Bread`: 1
    - `Jam`: 4
    - `Milk`: 3
- The function will take user inputs via HTML `<input>` tags to determine the quantities of each item.
- A button will trigger the `newOrder` function.
- The function will multiply the parameters with prices and add them all together.
- Display the bill’s value via the `<h1>` with ID “standardBill”.
- Accommodate a situation where if a customer orders all items in double quantity (i.e., 2), a discount of 20% must be calculated and displayed.
